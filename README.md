🔍 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Collection

Collected launch data using SpaceX API Extracted historical launch data using web scraping

2️⃣ Data Wrangling

Cleaned missing values Created landing success classification Selected important features

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

Launch success rate by site Payload vs landing success Orbit vs success rate Yearly launch trend

4️⃣ SQL Analysis

Performed queries to analyze:

Launch counts Payload distribution Success rates by site Booster version performance

5️⃣ Interactive Visualization

Folium map showing launch site locations Plotly Dash dashboard with:
Success pie chart Payload vs outcome scatter plot

6️⃣ Machine Learning Prediction

Models Used:

Logistic Regression Decision Tree Random Forest Support Vector Machine Model evaluation included:
Accuracy score Confusion matrix Best model comparison

📈 Results

Payload mass and launch site strongly influence landing success. Certain booster versions show higher reliability.
Machine learning models achieved strong prediction accuracy.
